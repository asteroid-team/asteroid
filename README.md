# Asteroid : Audio Source Separation on steroids
[![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis]

[![Slack][slack-badge]][slack-invite]

Asteroid is a Pytorch-based source separation and speech enhancement 
API that enables fast experimentation on common datasets. 
It comes with a source code written to support a large range 
of datasets, architectures, loss functions etc... and a set of
 recipes to reproduce some important papers.  
Asteroid is intended to be a __community-based project__ 
so hop on and help us !

### You use asteroid or you want to? 
Please, if you have found a bug, [open an issue][issue], 
if you solved it, [open a pull request][pr] !  
Same goes for new features, tell us what you want or help us building it !  
Don't hesitate to [join the slack][slack-invite] 
and ask questions / suggest new features there as well, we won't bite !

## Installation
In order to install Asteroid, clone the repo and install it using 
pip or python :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpariente/asteroid
cd asteroid
# Install with pip (in editable mode)
pip install -e .
# Install with python
python setup.py install
```
Asteroid is also on PyPI, you can install the latest release 
with `pip install asteroid`


## Highlights
Here is a list of notebooks showing example usage of Asteroid's features.
- [Permutation invariant training wrapper `PITLossWrapper`][pitwrapper_nb]
- [Filterbank API][fb_nb]


## Running a recipe
Running the recipes requires additional packages in most cases, 
we recommend running :
```bash
# from asteroid/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then choose the recipe you want to run and run it !
```bash
cd egs/wham/ConvTasNet
. ./run.sh
```
More information in [egs/README.md](./egs).

## Remote TensorBoard visualization
```bash
# Launch tensorboard remotely (default port is 6006)
tensorboard --logdir exp/tmp/lightning_logs/ --port tf_port

# Open port-forwarding connection. Add -Nf option not to open remote. 
ssh -L local_port:localhost:tf_port user@ip
```
Then open `http://localhost:local_port/`. If both ports are the same, you can 
click on the tensorboard URL given on the remote, it's just more practical.


## Guiding principles
* __Modularity.__ Building blocks are thought and designed to be seamlessly
plugged together. Filterbanks, encoders, maskers, decoders and losses are 
all common building blocks that can be combined in a 
flexible way to create new systems.  
* __Extensibility.__ Extending Asteroid with new features is simple.
Add a new filterbank, separator architecture, dataset or even recipe very 
easily.
* __Reproducibility.__ Recipes provide an easy way to reproduce 
results with data preparation, system design, training and evaluation in a 
same script. This is an essential tool for the community !
