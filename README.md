Asteroid is a Pytorch-based audio source separation toolkit 
that enables fast experimentation on common datasets. 
It comes with a source code thats supports a large range 
of datasets and architectures, and a set of
 recipes to reproduce some important papers.


### You use Asteroid or you want to? 
Please, if you have found a bug, [open an issue][issue], 
if you solved it, [open a pull request][pr] !  
Same goes for new features, tell us what you want or help us building it !  
Don't hesitate to [join the slack][slack-invite] 
and ask questions / suggest new features there as well !  
Asteroid is intended to be a __community-based project__ 
so hop on and help us !

## Installation
In order to install Asteroid, clone the repo and install it using 
pip or python :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mpariente/asteroid
cd asteroid
# Install install-required deps
pip install numpy Cython
# Install with pip in editable mode
pip install -e .
# Or, install with python in dev mode
# python setup.py develop
```
Asteroid is also on PyPI, you can install the latest release 
with
```bash
pip install numpy Cython
pip install asteroid
```

## Highlights
Here is a list of notebooks showing example usage of Asteroid's features.
- [Permutation invariant training wrapper `PITLossWrapper`][pitwrapper_nb]
- [Filterbank API][fb_nb]


## Running a recipe
Running the recipes requires additional packages in most cases, 
we recommend running :
```bash
# from asteroid/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then choose the recipe you want to run and run it !
```bash
cd egs/wham/ConvTasNet
. ./run.sh
```
More information in [egs/README.md](./egs).

You can also open an issue or make a PR to add something we missed in this list.

## TensorBoard visualization
The default logger is TensorBoard in all the recipes. From the recipe folder, 
you can run the following to visualize the logs of all your runs. You can 
also compare different systems on the same dataset by running a similar command
from the dataset directiories.
```bash
# Launch tensorboard (default port is 6006)
tensorboard --logdir exp/ --port tf_port
```
If your launching tensorboard remotely, you should open an ssh tunnel
```bash
# Open port-forwarding connection. Add -Nf option not to open remote. 
ssh -L local_port:localhost:tf_port user@ip
```
Then open `http://localhost:local_port/`. If both ports are the same, you can 
click on the tensorboard URL given on the remote, it's just more practical.


## Guiding principles
* __Modularity.__ Building blocks are thought and designed to be seamlessly
plugged together. Filterbanks, encoders, maskers, decoders and losses are 
all common building blocks that can be combined in a 
flexible way to create new systems.  
* __Extensibility.__ Extending Asteroid with new features is simple.
Add a new filterbank, separator architecture, dataset or even recipe very 
easily.
* __Reproducibility.__ Recipes provide an easy way to reproduce 
results with data preparation, system design, training and evaluation in a 
single script. This is an essential tool for the community !
