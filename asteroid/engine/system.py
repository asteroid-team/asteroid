class System(pl.LightningModule):
    """Base class for deep learning systems.
    Contains a model, an optimizer, a loss function, training and validation
    dataloaders and learning rate scheduler.

    Note that by default, any PyTorch-Lightning hooks are *not* passed to the model.
    If you want to use Lightning hooks, add the hooks to a subclass::

                return self.model.on_train_batch_start(batch, batch_idx, dataloader_idx)

    Args:
        model (torch.nn.Module): Instance of model.
        optimizer (torch.optim.Optimizer): Instance or list of optimizers.
        loss_func (callable): Loss function with signature
            (est_targets, targets).
        train_loader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): Training dataloader.
        val_loader (torch.utils.data.DataLoader): Validation dataloader.
        scheduler (torch.optim.lr_scheduler._LRScheduler): Instance, or list
            of learning rate schedulers. Also supports dict or list of dict as
            ``{"interval": "step", "scheduler": sched}`` where ``interval=="step"``
            for step-wise schedulers and ``interval=="epoch"`` for classical ones.
        config: Anything to be saved with the checkpoints during training.
            The config dictionary to re-instantiate the run for example.

    .. note:: By default, ``training_step`` (used by ``pytorch-lightning`` in the
        training loop) and ``validation_step`` (used for the validation loop)
        share ``common_step``. If you want different behavior for the training
        loop and the validation loop, overwrite both ``training_step`` and
        ``validation_step`` instead.

    For more info on its methods, properties and hooks, have a look at lightning's docs:
