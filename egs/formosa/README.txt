### Welcome to the demo recipe of the Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW) Project ###

The language habits of Taiwanese people are different from other Mandarin speakers (both accents and cultures) [1]. Especially Tainwaese use tranditional Chinese characters, i.e., 繁體中文). To address this issue, a Taiwanese speech corpus collection project "Formosa Speech in the Wild (FSW)" was initiated in 2017 to improve the development of Taiwanese-specific speech recognition techniques.

FSW corpus will be a large-scale database of real-Life/multi-gene Taiwanese Spontaneous speech collected and transcribed from various sources (radio, TV, open courses, etc.). To demostrate that this database is a reasonable data resource for Taiwanese spontaneous speech recognition research, a baseline recipe is provied here for everybody, especially students, to develop their own systems easily and quickly.

This recipe is based on the "NER-Trs-Vol1" corpus (about 150 hours broadcast radio speech selected from FSW). For more details, please visit:

If you want to apply the NER-Trs-Vol1 corpus, please contact Yuan-Fu Liao (廖元甫) via "yfliao@mail.ntut.edu.tw". This corpus is only for non-commercial research/education use and will be distributed via our GitLab server in https://speech.nchc.org.tw.

Any bug, errors, comments or suggestions are very welcomed.

[1] The languages of Taiwan consist of several varieties of languages under families of the Austronesian languages and the Sino-Tibetan languages. Taiwanese Mandarin, Hokkien, Hakka and Formosan languages are used by 83.5%, 81.9%, 6.6% and 1.4% of the population respectively (2010). Given the prevalent use of Taiwanese Hokkien, the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan has been to a great extent influenced by it.
