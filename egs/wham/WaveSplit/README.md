### WaveSplit

 we train on 1 sec now. 
 
 tried with 256 embedding dimension. 
 
 still does not work with oracle embeddings.
 
 not clear how in sep stack loss at every layer is computed ( is the same output layer used in all ?).
 Also no mention in the paper about output layer and that first conv has no skip connection.
