### About the MedleyDB dataset

MedleyDB is a dataset of annotated, royalty-free multitrack recordings. MedleyDB was curated primarily to support research on melody extraction, addressing important shortcomings of existing collections. For each song we provide melody f0 annotations as well as instrument activations for evaluating automatic instrument recognition. The dataset is also useful for research on tasks that require access to the individual tracks of a song such as source separation and automatic mixing.
