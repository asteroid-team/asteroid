This directory contains example scripts for CN-Celeb speaker 
verification. The CN-Celeb corpus is required, and can be 
downloaded from Openslr http://www.openslr.org/82/ or from 
CSLT@Tsinghua http://cslt.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/~data/CN-Celeb/

The subdirectories "v1" and so on are different speaker recognition 
recipes. The recipe in v1 demonstrates a standard approach using a 
full-covariance GMM-UBM, iVectors, and a PLDA backend.
