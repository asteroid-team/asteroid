 The SNIPS dataset is a ~54-hour corpus of wake word corpus covering 3300 speakers.
 The wake word is "Hey Snips" pronounced with no pause between the two words.
 It contains a large variety of English accents and recording environments.
 Negative samples have been recorded in the same conditions than wake-word utterances.
 To download the dataset you need to follow the instructions on

 The E2E LF-MMI recipe does not require any prior alignments for training
 LF-MMI, making the alignment more flexible during training. It can be optionally
 followed by a regular LF-MMI training to further improve the performance.
