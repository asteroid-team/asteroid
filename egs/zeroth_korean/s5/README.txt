Zeroth-Korean kaldi example is from Zeroth Project. Zeroth project introduces free Korean speech corpus and aims to make Korean speech recognition more broadly accessible to everyone. This project was developed in collaboration between Lucas Jo(@Atlas Guide Inc.) and Wonkyum Lee(@Gridspace Inc.). 

In this example, we are using 51.6 hours transcribed Korean audio for training data (22,263 utterances, 105 people, 3000 sentences) and 1.2 hours transcribed Korean audio for testing data (457 utterances, 10 people). Besides audio and transcription, we provide pre-trained/designed language model, lexicon and morpheme-based segmenter(morfessor)

The database can be also downloaded from openslr:

This folder contains a speech recognition recipe which is based on WSJ/Librispeech example.
