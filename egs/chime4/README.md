### The CHiME-4 dataset

The CHiME-4 dataset is part of the 4th CHiME speech separation and recognition challenge.

It was released in 2016 and revisits the datasets originally recorded for CHiME-3.

All data and information are available [here](http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/chime_challenge/CHiME4/index.html).

For now, this recipe only deals with the `real_1_ch_track` part of the dataset. 
As the channel to use for the training set wasn't defined by 
the challenge's rules, we will set it randomly.

**Note :**
This dataset uses real noisy data. This means the clean speech from the noisy
utterances is not available. This makes it unsuitable for the usual training 
procedure.
