What is Asteroid ?
==================

Asteroid is a PyTorch-based audio source separation toolkit.

The main goals of Asteroid are:

- Gather a wider **community** around audio source separation by lowering the barriers to entry.
- **Promote reproducibility** by replicating important research papers.
- Automatize most engineering and **make way for research**.
- Simplify **model sharing** to reduce compute costs and carbon footprint.


So, how do we do that? We aim to provide
- PyTorch ``Dataset`` for **common datasets**.
- Ready-to-use state-of-the art source separation architectures.
- **Configurable recipes** from data preparation to evaluation.
- **Pretrained models** for a wide variety of tasks and architectures.
