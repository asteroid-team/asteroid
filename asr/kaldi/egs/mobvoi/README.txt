 The Mobvoi dataset is a ~67-hour corpus of wake word corpus
 in Chinese covering 523 speakers. It is currently not publicly available.
 The wake word is "Hi Xiaowen" (in Pinyin).
 Each speakerâ€™s collection includes positive utterances and negative utterances
 recorded with different speaker-to-microphone distance and different
 signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio where noises are from typical home environments.
 The dataset is provided by Mobvoi. Inc.

 The recipe is in v1/

 The E2E LF-MMI recipe does not require any prior alignments for training
 LF-MMI, making the alignment more flexible during training. It can be optionally
 followed by a regular LF-MMI training to further improve the performance.
