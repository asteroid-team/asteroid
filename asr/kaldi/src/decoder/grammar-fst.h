/**
   GrammarFst is an FST that is 'stitched together' from multiple FSTs, that can
   recursively incorporate each other.  (This is limited to left-biphone
   phonetic context). This class does not inherit from fst::Fst and does not
   support its full interface-- only the parts that are necessary for the
   decoder to work when templated on it.

   The underlying FSTs that are stitched together are templated upon in
   GrammarFstTpl, thus allowing you to create a GrammarFst out of any
   type of FST class.

   The basic interface is inspired by OpenFst's 'ReplaceFst' (see its
   replace.h), except that this handles left-biphone phonetic context, which
   requires, essentially, having multiple exit-points and entry-points for
   sub-FSTs that represent nonterminals in the grammar; and multiple return
   points whenever we invoke a nonterminal.  For more information
   see \ref grammar (i.e. ../doc/grammar.dox).

   THREAD SAFETY: you can't use this object from multiple threads; you should
   create lightweight copies of this object using the copy constructor,
   e.g. `new GrammarFst(this_grammar_fst)`, if you want to decode from multiple
   threads using the same GrammarFst.

     Constructor.  This constructor is very lightweight; the only immediate work
     it does is to iterate over the arcs in the start states of the provided
     FSTs in order to set up the appropriate entry points.

     For simplicity (to avoid templates), we limit the input FSTs to be of type
     ConstFst<StdArc>; this limitation could be removed later if needed.  You
     can always construct a ConstFst<StdArc> if you have another StdArc-based
     FST type.  If the FST was read from disk, it may already be of type
     ConstFst, and dynamic_cast might be sufficient to convert the type.

     @param [in] nonterm_phones_offset   The integer id of the symbol
             "#nonterm_bos" in phones.txt.
     @param [in] top_fst    The top-level FST of the grammar, which will
              usually invoke the fsts in 'ifsts'.  The fsts in 'ifsts' may
              also invoke each other recursively.  Even left-recursion is
              allowed, although if it is with zero cost, it may blow up when you
              decode.  When an FST invokes another, the invocation point will
              have sequences of two special symbols which would be decoded as:
                  (#nonterm:foo,p1) (#nonterm_reenter,p2)
              where p1 and p2 (which may be real phones or #nonterm_bos)
              represent the phonetic left-context that we enter, and leave, the
              sub-graph with respectively.
     @param [in] ifsts   ifsts is a list of pairs (nonterminal-symbol,
              the HCLG.fst corresponding to that symbol).  The nonterminal
              symbols must be among the user-specified nonterminals in
              phones.txt, i.e. the things with names like "#nonterm:foo" and
              "#nonterm:bar" in phones.txt.  Also no nonterminal may appear more
              than once in 'fsts'.  ifsts may be empty, even though that doesn't
              make much sense.

/**
   This function prepares 'ifst' for use in GrammarFst: it ensures that it has
   the expected properties, changing it slightly as needed.  'ifst' is expected
   to be a fully compiled HCLG graph that is intended to be used in GrammarFst.
   The user will most likely want to copy it to the ConstFst type after calling
   this function.

   The following describes what this function does, and the reasons why
   it has to do these things:

     - To keep the ArcIterator code simple (to avoid branches in loops), even
       for expanded states we store the destination fst-instance index
       separately per state, not per arc.  This requires that any transitions
       across FST boundaries from a single FST must be to a single destination
       FST (for a given source state).  We fix this problem by introducing
       epsilon arcs and new states whenever we find a state that would cause a
       problem for the above.
     - In order to signal to the GrammarFst code that a particular state has
       cross-FST-boundary transitions, we set the final-prob to a nonzero value
       on that state.  Specifically, we use a weight with Value() == 4096.0.
       When the GrammarFst code sees that value it knows that it was not a
       'real' final-prob.  Prior to doing this we ensure, by adding epsilon
       transitions as needed, that the state did not previously have a
       final-prob.
     - For arcs that are final arcs in an FST that represents a nonterminal
       (these arcs would have #nonterm_exit on them), we ensure that the
       states that they transition to have unit final-prob (i.e. final-prob
       equal to One()), by incorporating any final-prob into the arc itself.
       This avoids the GrammarFst code having to inspect those final-probs
       when expanding states.
